# Category Theory for Programmers Exercises

Repo to hold the exercises created while reading the excellent book
[Category Theory for Programmers](https://www.blurb.co.uk/b/9621951-category-theory-for-programmers-new-edition-hardco)

## Running the code

The code is run using the [Ammonite](https://ammonite.io/) Scala REPL for
convenience & simplicity.
This will need to be installed first.
To run one of the exercises in the REPL:

```shell
amm -w -p exercises/4.4.1.scala
```

> This will run with the `-w` (watch) argument so that the source is recompiled
> on change, as well as the `-p <file>` argument to specify the exercise to run.
